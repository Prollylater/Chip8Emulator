# C8-Interpreter
A Simple Chip-8 emulator. It mainly allowed me to work with C for once and gave me a slight glimpse on what emulation could look like.
Based on: https://multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/

# Current State
The project is mostly done but some polishing might be required. A refactoring of the main.cpp could help as it was hasardly put together 
However, having spent an embarassing amount of time trying to make SDL work properly, (still some oddity despite all), i will put this on hold and move on to other projects.

# Usage
The code come with usable binary, a makefile. The SDl2 Library is a windows one working alongside MinGW
