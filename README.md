# C8-Interpreter
A Simple Chip-8 emulator to work with C for once. Based on: https://multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/

# Current State
The project is mostly done. Despite some polishing required, the chip was made. 
The project is in need of a refactoring on a lot of account, but having spent an embarassing amount of time trying to make SDL work properly, (still some oddity despite all), i will put this on hold and move on to other projects.

# Usage
The code come with usable binary, a makefile. The SDl2 Library is a windows one working alongside MinGW
